# CPqPy_V1
A COMSOL-PHREEQC coupled python framework for reactive transport modeling in unsaturated soil and saturated groundwater

The CPqPy framework coupling COMSOL and PHREEQC based on Python was developed. This framework can achieve the simulation of diversified situations including multi-physics coupling and geochemical reactions of soil and groundwater. The multi-physics coupling models are calculated in COMSOL, whereas PHREEQC was applied to calculate the geochemical models through the Phreeqpy library in Python.
